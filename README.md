### Assignment

At the workshop, you'll learn all the skills necessary to complete this assignment. It's due before the start of your follow-up Code Fellows course.

Demonstrate the following skills using **only** your Terminal, your text editor, and your web browser.

##### 1. Create a fork of this repository

##### 2. Clone the fork to your computer

##### 3. Create a new branch called `notes`

##### 4. Checkout the branch `notes`

##### 5. Create a directory with the same name as your GitHub username

For example, `codefellows`

##### 6. Create a `unix_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/unix_notes.txt`

##### 7. Add the notes about what you've learned about Unix to this file

For example,

```
cd <path> Changes the working directory to <path>
ls <path> Lists the directory content of <path>
...
```

##### 8. Create a `git_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/git_notes.txt`

##### 9. Add the notes about what you've learned about Git to this file

For example,

```
git add <file> Adds any changes inside <file> to the staging area
git commit -m '<message>' Commits the staging area to the repository with a <message>
...
```

##### 10. Add these untracked files to the staging area

##### 11. Commit the changes

##### 12. Push the branch to the `origin` remote on GitHub

##### 13. Send a pull request from this branch to Code Fellows' `master` branch


What contributed most to your learning in today's workshop?
Being able to work through the examples on my own computer and ask questions when a problem came up.  Getting a better general understanding of the unix command line and working with git was helpful and the timing in which the class was offered (approx a week before my F2 class was great.

What was least helpful in your learning?
Moving very quickly through the git pull requests was a challenge.  Not being able to practice something multiple times or have more mistakes come up--if there were more issues, I think that would have helped when issues come up in the future.

Would you recommend this workshop to a friend?
10--yes I would recommend this workshop to a friend.
